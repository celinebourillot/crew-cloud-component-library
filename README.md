# Project Structure

components : HTML structure for every main component of the website (nav, footer, slider, content blocks...) 

dist : minified css and javacript

pages : page templates, calling the components in the component folder

pattern-library : pattern library created with Astrum. I am adding all the components there as I finish them to keep track of it and easily reuse elements.

[Astrum Documentation](https://github.com/NoDivide/astrum)

src : scss, javascript files and images

I use npm and gulp to compile the scss and javascript.
